## Welcome to Tiktok Clone with Nextjs, Typescript, and login functionality with latest Google Indentity Services

### Summary:

I had learnt typescript during the development of the project. TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript that enables static/strong typing which maintains the naming consistency across the codebase to avoid errors on runtime. I employed Next.js as a monolithic application that comprises the client and web server in itself. It makes API calls to the sanity.io database to upload and retrieve users data. Users also have the capability to like and comment on the posts, as well as search by keywords or tags, and select a user to view the videos that have been uploaded by them.
